## Project Goal
This webpage serves to provide a centralized webpage that is responsive to different screen sizes to showcase deployed web appliations created by junior web developer, Michael Klein.  HTML and Advanced CSS were utilized to create this project.  The creator's intention is to further implement new skills, like Javascript, into this webpage as he progress through his coding bootcamp.
